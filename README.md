# FlavorfulBitesApp_HTML_CSS_JavaScript
This project, Flavorful Bites, is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and visually appealing online presence for our cake bakery. HTML structures the content, providing a robust framework for showcasing our offerings. CSS enhances the visual appeal with stylish layouts, colors, and typography that reflect the sweetness of our brand. JavaScript adds interactivity, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience. Together, these technologies bring Flavorful Bites to life, making it easy for visitors to explore our delectable creations.
What I used in my project;
# HTML Elements, Tags and Attributes
# CSS Styling, Padding, Margin etc.
# JavaScript Functions, Events, Selector, and Refactoring
